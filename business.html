                NWI Microgreens was a small business growing boutique heallthy micro greens or young salad
                greens harvested within 2 weeks of sprouting. The idea of NWI Microgreens wat to grow greens
                that were nutrient dense, fresh, and locally avaiable.
                In 2024 Emma sold NWI microgreens to a new owner in Mishawaka.

                    "I really enjoyed the process of learning about microgreens and how they grew.
                    I am gald I had the opportunity to make connections with the health and wellness
                    community like our good friend Jenn at Lakefront Nutrition. Many greens were donated
                    to the community food pantry during the year that NWI Microgreens operated in Whiting."
